Introduction
------------

The purpose of this project was to practise coding in Python by creating a web app using Flask and testing with Pytest.

Description:

A thermostat app; a user can increase, decrease or reset the temperature, and switch power-saving-mode on or off. The temperature text will change colour depending on the level of energy-usage.

App is deployed here: [py-thermostat.herokuapp.com](https://py-thermostat.herokuapp.com/)
